# hello-world
This is my first repository

Hello fellow github users. If you are reading this then you must have randomly stumbled it. I am currently learning how github works with the interest of persuing a greater understanding of programming and possibly create my own project. Every grand oak starts as a seed, yada yada and whatnot. Thanks for reading. Happy coding.
